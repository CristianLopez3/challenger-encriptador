## 🔍 Description 🔎
The challenge was to create a website that would allow us to encrypt any code that we <br> pass to it, this code had the following rules:
<ul> 
  <li> Desktop, tablet and mobile design </li>
  <li> Have an encrypt button that will encrypt the text and display it in another section. </li>
  <li> Have a button to decrypt the text we pass to it. </li>
  <li> have a button that will allow us to copy the encrypted or decrypted code. </il>
</ul>

### 📏 Encription Rules 📏
The main rule was that the vowels had to have a translation, which is as follows:
| VOWEL | TRANSLATE |
|-------|-----------|
|   a   |     ai    |
|   e   |   enter   |
|   i   |   imes    |
|   o   |   ober    |
|   u   |   ufat    |
